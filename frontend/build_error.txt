Error: unable to 
find directory 
entry in 
pubspec.yaml: C:\Use
rs\mrmoh\Desktop\pho
tos\frontend\assets\
icons\
Expected to find fonts for (MaterialIcons, packages/cupertino_icons/CupertinoIcons), but found (MaterialIcons). This usually means you are referring to font families in an IconData class but not including them in the assets section of your pubspec.yaml, are missing the package that would include them, or are missing "uses-material-design: true".
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 8892 bytes (99.5% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
